## Introduction

Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a two-player game where each player takes turns rolling a six-sided dice to accumulate points. The goal is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 or more.

## Rules

1. Each turn, a player rolls the dice, and the number rolled is added to their current score.
2. If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and their turn ends.
3. Players can choose to continue rolling to accumulate more points or hold to save their current score and switch to the next player.
4. The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.

## Game Flow

1. Start the game with an initial total score of 0 for both players.
2. Player 1 begins by rolling the dice.
   - If the roll is not a 1, the number is added to Player 1's current score.
   - If the roll is a 1, Player 1's turn ends, and their current score is reset to 0.
3. Player 1 can choose to roll again or hold.
   - If they choose to hold, their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes Player 2's turn.
   - If they choose to roll and get a 1, their current score resets to 0, and Player 2's turn begins.
4. The game continues with players taking turns until one player reaches or exceeds 100 points.

## Strategy Tips

- Be cautious when rolling to avoid getting a 1 and losing all your current points.
- Consider holding when you've accumulated a substantial number of points to secure them.
