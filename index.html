        <h1>Intro üé≤ üòç</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a two-player game where each player
          takes turns rolling a six-sided dice to accumulate points. The goal is
          to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 or more.
        </p>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Each turn, a player rolls the dice, and the number rolled is added
            to their current score.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and their
            turn ends.
          </li>
          <li>
            Players can choose to continue rolling to accumulate more points or
            hold to save their current score and switch to the next player.
          </li>
          <li>The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Game Flow</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start the game with an initial total score of 0 for both players.
          </li>
          <li>
            Player 1 begins by rolling the dice.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the roll is not a 1, the number is added to Player 1's
                current score.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the roll is a 1, Player 1's turn ends, and their current
                score is reset to 0.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Player 1 can choose to roll again or hold.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If they choose to hold, their current score is added to their
                total score, and it becomes Player 2's turn.
              </li>
              <li>
                If they choose to roll and get a 1, their current score resets
                to 0, and Player 2's turn begins.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The game continues with players taking turns until one player
            reaches or exceeds 100 points.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be cautious when rolling to avoid getting a 1 and losing all your
            current points.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider holding when you've accumulated a substantial number of
            points to secure them.
